For Project 2, I developed the code for the main loop of the application, which enabled the agent to determine its action strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation. While I was provided with a foundational framework, I created the logic for decision-making entirely on my own.

Reflecting on my learning, I approach problems as a computer scientist by formulating hypotheses and testing them through algorithms, a method that aligns with the scientific rigor of the field. 

Ethically, I believe my responsibility to both end users and organizations lies in ensuring transparency, particularly in machine learning. This includes identifying and addressing biases in models and openly sharing the sources of training data to build trust and accountability. This project reinforced the importance of combining technical skills with ethical considerations to create responsible and effective solutions.
